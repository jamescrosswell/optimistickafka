A hack-fest to experiment with kafka and event sourcing... I never finished this (the current implementation allows for glaring data inconsistencies) and concluded that, although event sourcing would be possible with kafka, it would be *way* easier with a transactional data store.

Still, there may be the odd snippet of useful code in here so I leave the repository here for posterity.
